# Project Name - Strapi Backend

Welcome to the Strapi Backend repository! This repository contains the code for the backend of a web application built using Strapi, an open-source headless CMS (Content Management System). The backend is responsible for managing and providing content to the frontend of the application.

## Prerequisites

- Node.js: Make sure you have Node.js installed on your system within the specified version range (14.19.1 to 18.x.x). You can download it from the official website: https://nodejs.org/
- Docker: Ensure that Docker is installed and running on your machine to start the local development database.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/strapi-backend.git
cd strapi-backend
```

2. Install the required dependencies:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn install

# Using npm
npm install
```

3. Create the development database (if needed):

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn createDevDatabase

# Using npm
npm run createDevDatabase
```

## Starting and Stopping the Database

To start the local development database, run the following command:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn db:start

# Using npm
npm run db:start
```

If you need to stop the database for any reason, use the following command:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn db:stop

# Using npm
npm run db:stop
```

## Running the Strapi Backend

Before running the Strapi backend, make sure you have the `.env` file present with the necessary configurations. If not, create one based on the provided `.env.example` file.

To start the Strapi backend, use the following command:

```bash
# Using yarn
yarn develop

# Using npm
npm run develop
```

Once the backend is up and running, you can access the admin console by navigating to `http://localhost:1337/admin`. Create a super user account through the registration process to access the content management console.
